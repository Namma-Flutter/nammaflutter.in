# nammaflutter.in

Official website for **Namma Flutter** — Chennai's largest Flutter developer community.

Built with [Jaspr](https://jaspr.site) in static mode: routes are pre-rendered to HTML at build time and deployed as a fully static site. Pure Dart, no Flutter SDK dependency, ships as a lightweight JS bundle.

---

## Pages

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing — hero, section previews, CTA |
| `/about` | Founding story, mission, stats |
| `/apps` | Open-source Flutter apps built by the community |
| `/programs` | Recurring programs — meetups, hackathons, workshops |
| `/events` | Past and upcoming events |
| `/team` | Founders and core team |
| `/store` | NammaStore (coming soon) |
| `/contact` | Socials, email, join CTA |

---

## Tech stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Framework | [Jaspr](https://jaspr.site) `^0.23` — static site generation |
| Language | Dart `3.11.5` |
| Routing | [jaspr_router](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr_router) |
| Styling | CSS-in-Dart via Jaspr's `Styles` API |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages (auto-deployed on push to `master`) |

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Dart `3.11.5` on PATH
- Jaspr CLI: `dart pub global activate jaspr_cli`

### Install dependencies

```bash
dart pub get
```

### Run dev server

```bash
jaspr serve
# → http://localhost:8080
```

Hot reload is enabled by default. Edit any `.dart` file in `lib/` and the page refreshes automatically.

### Production build

```bash
jaspr build
# Output: build/jaspr/
```

Jaspr pre-renders every route to `build/jaspr/` — `index.html`, `team/index.html`, `about/index.html`, etc. Deploy the whole folder to any static host.

### Other commands

```bash
# Analyze (no errors expected)
dart analyze lib/

# Format (120-char line width)
dart format --line-length 120 lib/

# Regenerate build_runner outputs (after adding/removing @client pages)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

---

## Deployment

Pushes to `master` trigger GitHub Actions which builds the site and deploys to GitHub Pages automatically. The workflow:

1. Runs `jaspr build --verbose` — pre-renders all routes to `build/jaspr/`
2. Uploads `build/jaspr/` as the Pages artifact
3. Deploys via `actions/deploy-pages`
